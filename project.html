Ahmednagar: Mata Parvatibai was born on this day on January 19, 1934 at Ruigvan (T.Karjat).
Shivajirao Narayanarao Nagwade and Bapu were born in a farming family. One of Srigonda Taluka
Wangdari is a village located at the end and on the banks of Ghodandi. I spent my childhood in this village.

Studied. As there is no facility of secondary education in the village, I am staying at Malegaon (T. Baramati) now
Studied secondary education. But unfortunately with the death of grandfather Shankarao (Tatya) Bapu left his education halfway
Returned to the village. Father is responsible for taking care of a large family of six brothers and five sisters in a joint family system
came While doing this, in 1958 Kaushalya Devi, daughter of Tukaram More of Varur Budrak (Shevgaon)
Father got married to him.While doing the best kind of farming in his own village, the father was from a drought-stricken taluka
The plight of the farmers could not be tolerated. Urashi felt that we should do something for the farmers.
After the drought of 1952, Bapu explained that the problem of water should be solved to get energy for agriculture

Shivajirao Nagwade was successful in getting approval of the dam. Srigonda due to horse water after horse dam came into existence
Sugarcane farming flourished in the taluk. What to do with that sugarcane? This thought came to father's mind. At that time at Belwandi
Dahanukara had a 250 ton private sugar factory.Sugarcane producing farmers, farm laborers, laborers in the taluka
If Dasalat is to be set up, there should be a co-operative sugar factory owned by the farmers.
They were longing. For this he fought against Dahanukas. Selling his private sugar factory
He completed the legal matters on a cooperative basis.By Baburao Dada Tanpure and Abasaheb Nimbalkar

Capital raised. Srigonda factory was set up and run successfully.Even some villages in the taluk have horse water
Many villages were deprived of water. Was suffering in drought. Something should be done for them
Father felt the same. When he was in the Communist Party, he united the leaders of all parties and fought for Mula and Kukdi Dam
